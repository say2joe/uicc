# Basic CSS Test
For this challenge you will be building an Instagram like modal. Build out the
modal using only HTML/CSS. Result should be as close as possible to the
`assets/css-test-final.jpg` image - it typically takes 30-40 minutes to complete.

#### Getting Started
* Use the `assets/css-test-specs.jpg` as your guide
* Use the provided `index.html` file to build out your div structure
	* Fonts and stylesheet are already included in the head
* Use the provided `style.css` file for adding styles
	* Some predefined stlyes have been added for convenience
* Images are provided and in the `images` directory


#### Note
The modal should ALWAYS be centered on the page even if the browser
window is resized. Again, ONLY use HTML/CSS.
Good luck, and have fun!
